# Real-time-collaborative-whiteboard

The problem this app solves :

In the pre covid era it was easy for students to create and showcase their creativity among their friends and with teachers with the help of pen and paper,
but now unfortunately it is not possible to do this in real time.

Solution : 

A real time collaborative whiteboard app where different users can interact on the same canvas and discuss the concepts more clearly.

# Features : 

1) App is integrated with a **real time collaborative whiteboard** where a user can draw or write and it will be reflected in the whiteboard of other users in
   real time.
2) Users can also **download the snapshot** of the whiteboard by pressing Download to image option below the whiteboard.
3) App is also integrated with a **real time video call facility** using a 3rd party API - https://videosdk.live/ where users can interact live using video call and 
   they can also discuss through chat.
